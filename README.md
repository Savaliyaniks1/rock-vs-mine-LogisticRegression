This article is about predicting SONAR rocks against Mines with the help of Machine Learning.
SONAR is an abbreviated form of Sound Navigation and Ranging. 
It uses sound waves to detect objects underwater. 
Machine learning-based tactics approaches have applications in detecting sonar signals and hence targets.
